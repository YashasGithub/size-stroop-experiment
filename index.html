  // IDEA: each element in the array will be a dictionary so that we can concurrently store information about the correctness of the response
  // MAIN TO DO: How can we expand this systematically to encompass all stimuli?

  //create an example stimulus
  // we're using z and m as respons keys here because they are clear left-right response keys that are far apart on the keyboard

  }

  // here's how we can construct a simple size stroop judgment trial
  // TO DO: Hm, there's quite a lot of whitespace below the image slide, making the prompt appear far below it. Maybe that could be improved?
  // OTHER TO DOs: what else do we need to add to the trial procedure? What other information should we store? How can we turn this into a complete experiment timeline?
